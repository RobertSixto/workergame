# workergame
A resource generation game I am developing.

Controls: 
Press the "create worker" button to create a worker. 
Press many times to create more. 
Press "c" to see worker information.
Click and hold a worker to drag him.
Drag a worker onto another worker of the same occupation and let go to combine them and level him up.

Game explanation:
Every thirty seconds or so workers will take a chance based roll to become "employed".
If a worker passes the roll, the worker  will fall into one of various occupations,
with many more to be added in the future.

There are 6 occupations at this time. In order of rarity from most common to least common they are:
1)Miner
2)Construction Worker
3)Soldier
4)Coder
5)Pirate
6)Sorcerer

The sorcerer is the rarest and has a 1 in 100 chance of appearing per employment roll per worker. 
Every employed worker generates a currency called "workercoin." The more rare the worker's occupation, the more coin they will generate. 
So, for instance, since the sorcerer is the rarest occupation, workers who are employed as sorcerers will generate more workercoin than any other worker.

Every worker has a level. Higher leveled workers generate more workercoin.
Newly created workers start at level 1. Unemployed workers cannot be leveled up. 
Workers that have fallen into an occupation can be leveled up by dragging them onto others workers of the same occupation and combining them.
The max level is 15.

The objective of the game for now is to level up workers and gather as much workercoin as possible.
